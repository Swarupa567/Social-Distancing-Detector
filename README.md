Created an AI Tool to help Customers monitor Social Distancing in the Workplace.

In the fight against the coronavirus, social distancing has proven to be a very effective measure to slow down the spread of the disease. While millions of people are staying at home to help flatten the curve, many people are still having to go to work everyday to make sure our basic needs are met.

To complement our customersâ€™ efforts and to help ensure social distancing protocol in their workplace, I have developed an AI-enabled social distancing detection tool that can detect if people are keeping a safe distance from each other by analyzing real time video streams from the camera.

## Requirements:
NumPy

OpenCV

Time and 

math

## working:
Detect the humans in the frame with yolov3 convolutional neural network.

Calculate the distance between all the instances of humans detected in the frame.

Classify the determined distances as 'Alert' or 'Ok' for social distancing.

## Demo:
